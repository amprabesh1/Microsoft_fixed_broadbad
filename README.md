## U.S. Fixed Broadband Insights â€“ Data Science Project

This project analyzes the 2025 U.S. Fixed Broadband coverage dataset from the Microsoft Airband Initiative and the FCCâ€™s Broadband Data Collection (BDC). The goal is to generate meaningful insights around internet accessibility, technology types, and speed disparities across residential and business sectors.

## Project Objectives

Using the dataset `bdc_us_fixed_broadband_summary_by_geography_D24_10jun2025.zip`, we explore:

1. **Coverage Drop-Off by Speed Tier**  
   How broadband access changes as the required minimum speed increases (e.g., from 25 Mbps to 1000 Mbps).

2. **Technology-wise Speed Coverage**  
   Comparing how different broadband technologies (e.g., wired, terrestrial) perform in delivering high-speed internet.

3. **Residential vs. Business Access Gaps**  
   Understanding the digital divide between business and residential users at various speed thresholds.
